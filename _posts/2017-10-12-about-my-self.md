Let's go to my hobbies

-  I learnt ABACUS when I was  10.
- I try games which help me increase my memory when ever I am free.

which means,

I try to memorize random  words in order and able to speak them out.

My ability untill now is 150 words, I am planning to reach 1500 and I wish to

crack GUINNESS WORLD RECORD in it.

I thank my parents for standing as a support all the time.

THANK you
